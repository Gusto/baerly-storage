# baerly-storage

**Storage is the missing primitive for agent-built software, and all you need is a library.**

`baerly-storage` is a library that turns AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or a
conformant S3-compatible bucket into a document database.
`baerly doctor --bucket` live-probes the conditional-write contract
before you trust a bucket. **There is no runtime. None.** No Baerly
daemon, no leader, no scheduler, no catalog, no database service bill,
no on-call. Coordination rides the request path — Cloudflare can finish
bounded maintenance with `ctx.waitUntil`, Node runs it inline — and the
only persistent component is your bucket.

The full Cloudflare Workers bundle (`cloudflare.js`) is ~113 KB
gzipped, the Node HTTP closure (`http.js`) is ~94 KB gzipped, and the
browser client (`client.js`) is ~5 KB gzipped. The whole public API fits
in a single ~12k-token `dist/API.md` — small enough that an LLM can hold
it in context.

[S3 does the hard parts](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/),
`baerly-storage` is the coordination that fixes the API. Built like git:
content-addressed documents, immutable log entries, and a single
CAS-advanced pointer to HEAD, per collection. Document model, live
queries, snapshot isolation — the whole surface in a `.d.ts` designed
for zero-shot use.

Apps sized for this primitive — small, server-only writes, ~10 GB
ceiling, mechanical exit to Postgres when they cross it — get a tool
that matches their shape instead of a stack that doesn't.

```
Compute   →  FaaS
Tokens    →  LLM API
Storage   →  this.
```

Almost every team already has an object-storage bucket — for exports,
backups, CSV graveyards. The security review happened years ago; the
budget exists.

## Quick start

```sh
pnpm create @gusto/baerly-storage@latest -- my-app --target=cloudflare
cd my-app && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

For the Cloudflare target, `pnpm dev` boots Vite + workerd on `:5173`,
so `/v1/*` and the React UI share one origin. No S3 creds are needed
in development.

For Node, scaffold with `--target=node`; `pnpm dev` also runs on
`:5173` through Vite middleware over `LocalFsStorage`, and production
uses `pnpm start` to run the Node listener anywhere Node runs —
Railway, Render, Fly, Docker, bare VMs, on-prem boxes.

## The storage backend

```diff
- docker-compose.yml
- init.sql
- prisma/schema.prisma
- migrations/0001_initial.sql
- RLS policies
- DATABASE_URL secret
- connection pool (pgbouncer)
- pager rotation
-
+ // baerly.config.ts
+ export default defineConfig({
+   app: "tickets",
+   collections: { tickets: {} },
+   target: "cloudflare",
+ });
```

Your data lives in your bucket. The entire public surface fits in `.d.ts`
files — no DDL, no SQL strings, no generated migration ceremony for
ordinary schema shape changes.

## In code

```ts
// server — writes land in your R2 bucket
await db.collection("tickets")
  .insert({ title: "Onboard Alex", status: "open" });

// client — reactive across every open tab
const open = useQuery(
  (c) => c.collection("tickets").where({ status: "open" }).all(),
  [],
);
// open.status → "loading" | "ok" | "error"; open.data → your rows
```

## Cheat sheet

```ts
// reads — Collection or, after a modifier, Query
db.collection("tickets").get(id);                       // by id
db.collection("tickets").where({ status: "open" }).all();
db.collection("tickets").where(q => q.gte("count", 1)).count();

// writes — by id on Collection, bulk on Query
db.collection("tickets").insert({ status: "open", title: "ship it" });
db.collection("tickets").update(id, { status: "closed" });   // merge-patch
db.collection("tickets").where({ status: "closed" }).delete();
```

| Surface | Vocabulary |
|---|---|
| **Verbs** | `first` `all` `count` `get` · `insert` `update` `replace` `delete` |
| **Modifiers** | `where` `order` `limit` |
| **Operators** | `eq` `gt` `gte` `lt` `lte` `in` |
| **Errors** | one `BaerlyError`, discriminate by `.code` (`Conflict`, `NotFound`, `SchemaError`, …) |

## Why?

- **An API an LLM can use first try.** The whole public surface fits in
  `.d.ts` files. No DDL. No raw SQL. Discriminated string errors.
  Provisioning is `pnpm install`, not a cloud-console detour. The
  vocabulary is intentionally small enough to hold in context.
- **Idle rounds to zero.** No $5/mo floors multiplied across forty
  abandoned internal tools the loop produced last quarter. There is
  no per-app database service bill; the runtime is a rounding error
  against the bucket.
- **No hostage situation.** Log entries are Debezium-style CDC change
  events, and snapshot export is shipped. `baerly export
  --target=postgres` gives you the mechanical data handoff on the day
  an app outgrows this.
- **Honest about its envelope.** Sized for ~10 GB / tenant,
  ~30 writes/min/collection sustained, ~100 collections / tenant.
  Crossing any of those is the success signal to graduate.
