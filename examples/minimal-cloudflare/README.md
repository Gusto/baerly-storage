# minimal-cloudflare

A baerly app scaffolded with `@gusto/create-baerly-storage` for the **Cloudflare
Workers** target. Single-bucket R2-backed deployment via the
`@gusto/baerly-storage/cloudflare` adapter. Ships `auth: "none"` so the
day-1 happy path works with zero env vars; flip to Cloudflare
Access or a shared secret before deploy — see "Going to
production" below.

**The only persistent component is your R2 bucket** — there is no Worker to keep warm, no database daemon to operate, no idle bill, and maintenance is automatic and write-triggered (no cron, no sidecar, no scheduler).

## Run locally

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` runs `vite`. The `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` runs your Worker
inside `workerd` next to the SPA dev server, so `GET /` hits the SPA
on `http://localhost:5173/` and anything the Worker handles
(e.g. `GET /v1/healthz`) is served on the same origin. First run
downloads the `workerd` binary.

`pnpm build` runs `tsc -b && vite build`; the SPA lands in
`dist/client/` for the `assets:` binding in `wrangler.jsonc` to ingest
on deploy.

`pnpm typecheck` runs `tsc -b --noEmit` across both TS project
references.

## Deploy

```sh
# One-command deploy. baerly reads `baerly.config.ts:target`, finds
# `wrangler.jsonc`, and runs:
#   wrangler deploy --x-provision --x-auto-create
# which auto-creates the declared R2 bucket(s) before the deploy.
# When the experimental flag is unavailable, baerly falls back to
# `wrangler r2 bucket create` + `wrangler deploy`.
baerly deploy

# Verify the deployed config — bindings, secrets, optional triggers.
baerly doctor --target=cloudflare
```

`baerly doctor --target=cloudflare` warns on `auth: "none"` for
deploy targets — see "Going to production" below to flip the
posture before shipping.

If you'd rather run the steps by hand: `pnpm build` → `wrangler r2
bucket create minimal-cloudflare` → `wrangler deploy` from this
directory. The `assets:` binding in `wrangler.jsonc` picks up
`dist/client/` automatically.

## Secrets

Public configuration (`APP`, `TENANT`) lives in
`wrangler.jsonc:vars`. The default `auth: "none"` posture
needs no secrets. If you adopt a "Going to production" recipe:

- **Pattern A (CF Access):** `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` +
  `CF_ACCESS_AUDIENCE_TAG` go in `wrangler.jsonc:vars` (they're
  public identifiers, not secrets).
- **Pattern B (`auth: "shared-secret"`):** `SHARED_SECRET` is a
  secret — `.dev.vars` for `wrangler dev`, `wrangler secret put
  SHARED_SECRET` for production. Each secret is encrypted at rest
  and exposed on `env` at runtime.

## Next steps

1. **Read `AGENTS.md`** for the agent-facing guide — predicates,
   indexes, schemas, auth recipes, write-triggered maintenance, and the
   graduation criteria. Codex CLI reads `AGENTS.md`; Claude Code
   reads `CLAUDE.md`; both files are byte-identical so either
   surface lands you the same context.
2. **Declare your first collection schema** in `baerly.config.ts`
   via `defineConfig({ collections: { ... } })` and pass it to
   `Db.create({ ..., collections })`. Schema validation is live;
   bad inserts return 400.
3. **Set up production auth** — follow `AGENTS.md` → "Going to
   production". Pattern A wires CF Access via an env-aware factory
   `verifier:` override; Pattern B flips `auth: "shared-secret"`.
   `baerly doctor --target=cloudflare` reports any gaps.
4. **Check usage trends** — run the current operation-cost
   projection:

   ```sh
   baerly cost --bucket=<bucket-uri> --collection=<collection-name>
   ```

   Then pipe canonical logs to your observability system for 7-day /
   30-day write-rate trends. The graduation ceiling is described in
   the "When to graduate" section below.

## When to graduate

baerly is designed for the small-to-medium operating point. Past these
thresholds, S3 list-prefix latency and per-class operation pricing
start to dominate, and you're better off on a real database:

- **~30 writes / minute / collection**
- **~10 GB / tenant**
- **~100 collections / tenant**

When you cross the soft ceiling, graduation is mechanical:
`baerly export --target=postgres` walks your log entries (already Debezium-style CDC change events) into a real DB. If your
deploy target is Cloudflare Workers and you'll accept Cloudflare
lock-in, [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) is cheaper
per-write at M-size and is a natural next step. If you're on
AWS, on-prem, or want your data portable, managed Postgres is
the typical destination. Either way — graduation is a Baerly win,
not a churn event.

**Export to a real database** (swap `--target=` for `sqlite`,
`postgres`, or `d1`):

```sh
baerly export --target=postgres \
  --bucket=s3://minimal-cloudflare --app=minimal-cloudflare --tenant=<your-tenant> \
  --collection=<collection-name> --output=./out.sql
```

The export is a **point-in-time** snapshot and honors any active
schema on the collection. Your data was already in your bucket and
your code is a portable HTTP server, so the graduation doesn't
require vendor cooperation.

## Production auth

The scaffold ships `auth: "none"` so the day-1 happy path works
with zero env vars; every request resolves to `config.tenant`.
Before deploy, follow `AGENTS.md` → "Going to production":

- **Pattern A — CF Access (recommended).** Same artifact in dev and
  prod; the factory `verifier:` override engages when
  `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` + `CF_ACCESS_AUDIENCE_TAG` are present in
  `wrangler.jsonc:vars`. The `cloudflareAccess()` preset
  (re-exported from `@gusto/baerly-storage/auth`) reads the JWT off
  `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`, validates it against your team's JWKS,
  and pins `tenantPrefix` to `config.tenant` unless you pass an
  explicit tenant claim.
- **Pattern B — `auth: "shared-secret"`.** Single-tenant
  server-to-server callers. Flip `auth` in `baerly.config.ts` and
  set `SHARED_SECRET` via `wrangler secret put`.

## Pointers

- `baerly.config.ts` — app config (`app`, `tenant`, `target`, `domain`).
- `src/server/index.ts` — Worker fetch entry.
- `wrangler.jsonc` — Cloudflare Worker manifest (R2 binding, `assets:`, vars).
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite + `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`.
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — agent-facing guide (byte-identical).
