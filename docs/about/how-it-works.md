# How it works

The whole thing in plain language. This is the bridge between the
[product thesis](thesis.md) (the _why_) and the formal
[protocol spec](../spec/sync-protocol.md) (the precise _what_). If
you can explain this page to someone, you understand Baerly.

## The one idea to anchor on

**There is no database server.** The "database" is just a pile of
files (objects) in an S3 bucket. `baerly-storage` is a _library_ — a
set of rules for how to lay out those files and how to change them
safely. Nobody is running a daemon in the middle. When your code
"talks to the database," it is doing `GET` and `PUT` on objects in a
bucket and nothing more.

So the real question is: _how do you get database behavior out of a
dumb bucket?_ That is the entire trick.

## What's in the bucket

When you insert a row, the library does not overwrite one big "table"
file. It writes a few small, separate, immutable objects:

- **A content object** — the actual row data (`{ body: "buy milk" }`),
  stored under a content-addressed key (a hash of its bytes).
- **A log entry** — a tiny append-only record: "at this point, this
  row was inserted." The history.
- **Index objects** — small marker files that make lookups fast, so a
  read doesn't have to scan everything.
- **`current.json`** — the single most important object. It is a
  per-collection pointer that says _"the current state of this
  collection is described by these objects."_ The table of contents.

Every collection has its own `current.json`, its own integer log, and
its own CAS hotspot. To know what a collection _is_ right now, you read
that collection's `current.json`, then follow the snapshot and integer
log range it names. Index objects can help narrow the read, but the
snapshot plus log are the source of truth.

That per-collection pointer has a corollary worth stating plainly: a
write flips exactly one collection's `current.json`, so writes that span
two different collections are independent — neither ordered nor atomic
with respect to each other. Each collection linearizes on its own; there
is no cross-collection transaction. Needing two collections to commit
together is a signal you've outgrown the model (the formal statement is
in [`spec/sync-protocol.md`](../spec/sync-protocol.md)).

## What a write does

Say you insert a row. The library does this, in order:

1. **PUT the content** — write the row's bytes as a new object.
2. **PUT/DELETE the index entries** — update the lookup markers.
3. **PUT the log entry** — append "inserted row X" to the history.
4. **Swap the pointer** — update `current.json` to point at the new
   state.

Steps 1–3 do not change the visible database state, because
`current.json` does not point at the new log range yet. The database
only "changes" at step 4, the instant `current.json` flips. Until
then the artifacts are invisible scaffolding.

## The part that makes it safe

Step 4 is where two writers at once could clobber each other. S3 has
one feature that saves us: a **conditional PUT** — "write this object
_only if_ it hasn't changed since I last read it." Compare-and-swap.

So the swap really means:

> "Set `current.json` to my new version, **but only if** it is still
> the exact version I read a moment ago."

- Nobody else wrote in the meantime → the swap succeeds. Done.
- Someone slipped a write in first → the conditional PUT is
  **rejected**. The library notices, re-reads the now-newer
  `current.json`, redoes its work on top of the latest state, and
  tries the swap again.

That retry loop is the entire concurrency story. No locks, no
coordinator, no server holding state — S3's atomic conditional-write
_is_ the coordination. That is why the pitch is "Just a Bucket."

**Retries can't duplicate committed rows.** Content keys are hashes,
so re-writing the same post-image is a harmless no-op. Log entries are
created with "only if absent"; if the writer retries after it already
wrote its own single-entry log but lost the `current.json` swap, it can
recognize that log by its random per-commit session and adopt it. A
different writer's log at the same sequence is a conflict, not a
duplicate.

One subtler case the CAS doesn't cover on its own: a _zombie_ writer
— one that paused for a long time (a slow VM, a suspended laptop) and
wakes up holding a stale view of the world. To stop it from quietly
clobbering newer state, `current.json` also carries an ever-increasing
_epoch_; a writer that finds the epoch has moved past its own is
_fenced_ — it aborts instead of retrying. The formal version of all of
this — fencing, the write and read algorithms, the causal-consistency
guarantees — lives in
[`spec/sync-protocol.md`](../spec/sync-protocol.md), with the
adversarial fencing model in
[`spec/writer-fence-adversarial-model.md`](../spec/writer-fence-adversarial-model.md).

## What a read does

Much simpler:

1. Read `current.json` (the pointer).
2. Load the _snapshot_ it names (a single object holding the rolled-up
   state up to some point), then replay the handful of log entries
   added since — folding inserts, updates, and deletes on top.
3. Hand back the data.

Because a collection's `current.json` only ever flips atomically to a
fully-consistent state, a reader never sees a half-finished write. It
sees the state from _before_ the swap or _after_ it — never the
middle.

## What about the ever-growing log?

Two questions fall out of the model so far: if the log is
append-only, doesn't it grow without bound? And what happens to the
content/log objects a writer already PUT when it crashes _before_ the
pointer swap?

Both are handled by **maintenance**, which is two jobs:

- **Compaction** folds a run of log entries into a fresh snapshot and
  advances `current.json` to point at it — so a read replays a short
  tail instead of the entire history. The old log entries become
  unreferenced.
- **Garbage collection** sweeps objects nothing points to anymore:
  superseded snapshots, compacted-away log entries, and the orphaned
  content from a crashed write. Most crash residue is invisible because
  `current.json` never referenced it, so no reader ever saw it; GC
  tidies it up later. Deletes go through a grace window, so a slow
  in-flight reader is never pulled out from under.

There used to be a liveness edge case here, and it is **gone by
construction**: because the numbered `log/<seq>` create _is_ the commit,
there is no separate `current.json` swap to crash between. A writer can
never leave a committed log entry unacknowledged, so the old
orphan-at-the-tail wedge — where a crashed write could block all future
writes to the collection — cannot happen anymore. The entire
orphan-wedge class is eliminated. The formal version lives in
[`spec/sync-protocol.md`](../spec/sync-protocol.md#crash-safety).

Here is the part that matters for the mental model: **maintenance is
not a daemon.** There is no cron job, no sidecar, no background
process. It runs opportunistically from ordinary writes — a cheap
size-ratio check on the write path, and when it trips, a bounded chunk
of compaction or GC piggybacks on that write. Cloudflare can finish that
chunk after the response with `ctx.waitUntil`; Node runs it inline.
**Reads are pure: they never run maintenance.** An idle bucket does
nothing and pays nothing. This is what makes the project's _"There is no
runtime. None."_ literally true: no resident Baerly process exists
between requests. (Teams that _want_ batched maintenance windows can
call `runScheduledMaintenance` from their own scheduler, but it's an
opt-in convenience, never a requirement.) The design precedent is
PostgreSQL's HOT pruning / autovacuum; the full rationale is in
[`thesis.md`](thesis.md) → "Runtime model: nothing resident between
requests."

## Where the types and schema fit

Your `baerly.config.ts` declares the collections and, optionally, a
Standard Schema v1 validator for each. The scaffolds use Zod, but the
API accepts any Standard Schema v1 implementation. That one file does
two jobs from a single definition:

- **At write time**, the server runs the schema as a validator — bad
  data is rejected before any object is written.
- **At compile time**, your code derives its row type from the same
  schema (`type Note = z.infer<typeof NoteSchema>`), so the editor
  knows the shape.

Add a field to the schema and it lands in both places at once: the
runtime gate and the static type. Ordinary schema shape changes do not
need DDL or generated SQL migrations; data migrations are still explicit
versioned scripts.

## The typed layers, top to bottom

The "actions" you call — `collection("notes").insert(...)`,
`.where(...).all()` — are defined _once_ as a typed interface, then
fulfilled by different layers depending on where the code runs.

```
       collection("notes").insert({ body })
                       │
   ┌───────────────────┴───────────────────┐
   │ CLIENT implements the interface       │  encode
   │   → POST /v1/c/notes  { doc }         │ ─────────►  the wire
   └───────────────────────────────────────┘
                                                  │
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐      │ decode
   │ ROUTER reads the request,             │ ◄────┘
   │   calls the real action               │
   └──────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                      │
   ┌──────────────────▼───────────────────┐
   │ SERVER implements the interface      │
   │   → PUT content / log / index        │
   │   → CAS-swap current.json            │
   └──────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                      ▼
                  S3 bucket
```

Reading that chain top to bottom:

- **The protocol defines the actions as types.** A typed menu —
  `insert`, `update`, `where`, `order`, `first`, `all` — with no
  implementation. Just the shapes.
- **The server _implements_ that menu against S3.** This is the write
  dance above: it turns `insert(...)` into the PUT-then-CAS sequence.
- **The HTTP router translates the wire.** It receives a request,
  un-does what the client encoded, and calls the genuine server
  action — then serializes the result back. It holds no logic of its
  own.
- **The client _re-implements the same menu_ over HTTP.** Each method,
  instead of touching the bucket, encodes a request to the server.
  Same interface, different backend: the server's backend is the
  bucket; the client's backend is the server. That is why the same
  line of code type-checks on both sides.
- **The React bindings add reactivity, not new actions.** `useQuery`
  / `useMutation` / `BaerlyProvider` _call_ the client and wrap those
  calls in React's render model — live subscriptions that re-render
  when the data changes, plus loading/error state. They add _when it
  runs and how the result reaches the screen_, never new database
  semantics.
