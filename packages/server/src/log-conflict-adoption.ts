/**
 * Self-session log-conflict adoption — the one decision that
 * distinguishes a retry of our own prior commit attempt from a
 * peer racing us at the same `seq`.
 *
 * Background. `Writer.#singleAttemptCommit` creates each log entry
 * with `If-None-Match: "*"` — and that create IS the commit. A 412 on
 * `/log/<seq>.json` can mean either
 *
 *   (a) a peer genuinely won that seq (a foreign entry is committed
 *       there); or
 *   (b) our OWN previous attempt landed the committing log create but
 *       its ack was lost — we never observed the `200` — and we're now
 *       re-driving the same logical commit.
 *
 * This function makes the (a)/(b) call. It is callable, separately
 * testable, and patent-disclosable in isolation from the rest of the
 * commit path.
 *
 * ## Soundness invariant
 *
 * Adoption is sound iff all four hold:
 *
 *   1. **Same session.** `existing.session === self.session`. The
 *      session id is a per-commit, in-RAM-only secret minted at
 *      `Writer.commit` from `crypto.randomUUID().slice(0,
 *      SESSION_ID_LENGTH)`; an adversary with bucket-write access
 *      can forge any other field but cannot forge a value they
 *      did not observe being PUT.
 *   2. **Matching seq.** `existing.seq === self.expectedSeq`. The
 *      seq match is also implied by the key shape (the writer
 *      reads `/log/<expectedSeq>.json`), but is re-asserted here
 *      so the invariant is visible at the decision site.
 *   3. **Matching write intent.** The occupant's writer-minted log
 *      fields match the entry this writer just attempted to create.
 *      Same session + same seq alone is not sufficient: a collision,
 *      test seam, or out-of-model bucket writer must not be able to
 *      make this writer adopt a different logical mutation.
 *   4. **Single-input commit.** `self.batchSize === 1`. Every
 *      commit is single-input now, so this always holds; the guard
 *      is retained as a defensive invariant (its removal is the
 *      deferred follow-up tracked as D1.5). It is sound only for a single-input
 *      commit because per-input adoption decisions would not
 *      compose with the single-key single-write commit (the one
 *      `log/<seq>` create is the all-or-nothing commit point).
 *
 * When any of (1)/(2)/(3)/(4) fails, the caller MUST refuse adoption
 * and treat the occupant as a conflicting committed entry.
 *
 * ## Threat model
 *
 * The adversary may (a) write arbitrary bytes to any key in the
 * bucket, (b) replay any PUT they previously observed on the wire,
 * (c) reorder or drop network packets between the writer and the
 * bucket. The adversary may NOT (d) read the writer's local RAM
 * and therefore cannot learn the per-commit `session` id before
 * observing the writer's own `/log/<seq>.json` PUT. Under these
 * constraints, conditions (1)+(2)+(3)+(4) close every attack path in
 * the adversarial-replay property test
 * (`tests/integration/log-conflict-adversarial.test.ts`).
 *
 * **Pinned by:** `tests/integration/log-conflict-forgery.test.ts`
 * exercises the session-id-unguessability claim under a
 * `ForgeryStorage` adversary that plants arbitrary entries at the
 * writer's expected log key. Property verified by default at
 * `numRuns: 1000`; `FC_NUM_RUNS=10000` for the hardening sweep.
 *
 * ## Prior art
 *
 * SlateDB's manifest-pivot writer protocol (rfcs/0001-manifest.md,
 * scenarios 1–4) is the closest published prior art on the broader
 * commit-protocol skeleton. SlateDB's scenario 3 — "conflicting SST
 * has same `writer_epoch` as me" — is explicitly labelled an
 * **illegal state that should panic**. The three-clause adoption
 * decision encoded here (same session ∧ matching seq ∧ matching intent ∧ single-input)
 * recognises that case as the writer's own prior in-flight attempt
 * and adopts it as success rather than aborting, closing the recovery
 * gap SlateDB leaves to operator intervention.
 *
 * Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake commits surface analogous failures as
 * `CommitFailedException` / commit-conflict retries; neither inspects
 * the conflicting object to determine ownership.
 *
 * See `docs/spec/prior-art.md` for the consolidated IDS-shaped
 * differentiation.
 *
 * @see docs/spec/sync-protocol.md §"Contention and retries"
